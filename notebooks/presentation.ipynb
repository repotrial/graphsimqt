    "- **Globally**, the heterogeneous networks used in NetDR clearly mirror the information contained in independent reference networks based on comorbidities and shared drug-disease indications.\n",
    "- Hence, we have shown that **NetDR does have a data-informed foundation** beyond its intuitive appeal and that the obtained candidate drugs **do have prior plausibility**.\n",
    "- **However:** If we zoom-in on individual diseases or drugs, the correlation with the reference networks is often no longer visible.\n",
    "- Consequently, **individual predictions must always be scrutinized** for plausibility **by domain experts**.\n",
    "- Hence, user-friendly **expert-in-the-loop** solutions are indespensable in NetDR."
