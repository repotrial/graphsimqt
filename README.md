# GraphSimQT: A Graph Similarity Quantification Tool



## Installation

Download the repository.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/repotrial/graphsimqt
cd graphsimqt
```

Install all dependencies via [conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/) and activate the environment:

```sh
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate graphsimqt
```




## Re-running the analyses

Run the shortest path analyses (takes a while):

```sh
(graphsimqt) python -m graphsimqt.analyses.run_shortest_path_analyses
```

Run the similarity analyses based on the graph edit distance (takes even longer):

```sh
(graphsimqt) python -m graphsimqt.analyses.run_similarity_analyses
```

The results will be saved in subdirectories of the `results` directory.



## Plotting the results for global and local analyses of diseasome and drugomes

Once all results have been computed, you can plot by executing all steps in the Jupyter notebooks `notebooks/plots_uniform_EEC.ipynb`, `notebooks/plots_rankBased_EEC.ipynb`, and `notebooks/plots_heatmaps.ipynb`.


## Viewing the results for global and local analyses

Have a look at the Juptyer notebooks `notebooks/plots_uniform_EEC.ipynb`, `notebooks/plots_rankBased_EEC.ipynb`, and `notebooks/plots_heatmaps.ipynb` (plain markdown, you do not need to re-run anything) for the results of the performed analyses. If you have installed `RISE` as specified in the YAML environment, you can view the notebooks in presentation view.


## Using GraphSimQT for custom input

Each Python module `MODULE_NAME.py` contained in the `graphsimqt` package can be used from the command line or as a library function. For information on the required input parameters, print the help messages of the command line interfaces:

```sh
(graphsimqt) python -m graphsimqt.MODULE_NAME -h
```

Alternatively, display the docstring of the library functions:

```python
import graphsimqt
help(graphsimqt.MODULE_NAME)
```
